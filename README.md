# SOLID Principles ðŸ§©

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that explains and demonstrates the five **SOLID principles** of object-oriented programming with practical Python examples.

## ðŸ“– Overview
The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that make software:
- Easier to understand  
- More flexible  
- Maintainable over time  

The notebook includes explanations and code implementations for each principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have only one reason to change.  
   âœ” Example: File manager class separated into read/write responsibilities.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  
   âœ” Example: Shapes class hierarchy with `area` and `perimeter` methods.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.  
   âœ” Example: Rectangle and Square classes used interchangeably.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they donâ€™t use.  
   âœ” Example: Separate interfaces for Printer, Fax, and Scanner.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.  
   âœ” Example: Frontend depending on abstract data source, not concrete class.
